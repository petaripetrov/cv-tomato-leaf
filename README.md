# Comparative Analysis of ViT and ResNet Architectures for Disease Detection in Tomato Leaf Images

This repo contains the notebook used for the blogpost <a href="https://hackmd.io/@petaripetrov/B1QQal5XR">"Comparative Analysis of ViT and ResNet Architectures for Disease Detection in Tomato Leaf Images"</a>, 
which compares the accuracy and training speed of ViT-base and ResNet-50 at classifying tomato diseases in images. This project was part of the Seminar Computer Vision by Deep Learning course at Delft University of Technology.
